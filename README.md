Welcome to my Digital Electronics Notes repository! 🎉

These notes were carefully compiled during my training period at IIIT Bangalore 🏫. I made it a habit to write daily notes with dates 📅 to track all the concepts covered each day.

This training was conducted under the guidance of my amazing trainer, Shashikant Sharma Sir 👨‍🏫.

Inside, you’ll find detailed and organized notes covering various topics in digital electronics ⚙️🔢, perfect for learning and quick revision.

Feel free to browse, learn, and use these notes! 🚀
